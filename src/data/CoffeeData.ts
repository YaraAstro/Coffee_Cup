Coarsely ground coffee is steeped in hot water in a cylindrical glass or metal carafe, and after a few minutes, a plunger with a mesh filter is pressed down to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee. This results in a fuller-bodied cup with a rich and bold flavor profile. French press coffee tends to retain more oils and sediment from the beans, contributing to its robust texture and intense taste. It's favored by those who appreciate a stronger brew and enjoy the ritualistic aspect of manual coffee preparation.`,

Ground coffee is steeped in cold water for an extended period, typically 12 to 24 hours, allowing the flavors to slowly infuse without extracting the acidity present in hot brewed coffee. The result is a concentrated coffee concentrate that can be diluted with water or milk and served over ice. Cold brew is praised for its sweetness, low acidity, and subtle undertones, making it a refreshing alternative to traditional hot coffee, especially during warmer months. Its versatility also lends itself well to creative flavor infusions and specialty drinks.`,
